After decades in the industry, I'm opening the doors to my personal technical space. Welcome to the Lair! This site—my technical portfolio under the alias **DraakUSA**—is where I document my deep dive into systems architecture, explore modern paradigms, and share the projects I build for the sheer joy of engineering.

## 💡 Why Start a Blog Now? (The Senior Perspective)

Throughout my career, I've focused on building robust, mission-critical systems. My passion for programming started in **8th grade**, and with **over 20 years of experience** as a Senior Software Engineer, I’ve seen technologies rise and fall.

This site is driven by three core motivations:

1.  **Knowledge Consolidation:** To document the hard-won lessons, architectural patterns, and design philosophies accumulated over decades in a structured, accessible format.
2.  **Modern Exploration:** To actively engage with cutting-edge technologies like **Rust, WebAssembly, and advanced Cloud practices** and share honest assessments of their practical applications.
3.  **Demonstrating Competency:** To provide concrete, public examples of my coding standards, problem-solving approach, and technical leadership beyond a traditional resume.

If you value **robustness, clarity, and pragmatic engineering**, you're in the right place.

## 🛠️ What You Can Expect to Find

I plan to focus on content that reflects my core competencies as a systems architect:

* **Deep Dives on Architecture:** Analysis of distributed systems, database optimization, and strategies for minimizing technical debt.
* **Systems Implementation:** Tutorials and discussions on low-level performance (C) and large-scale backend services (Python).
* **Open Source & Personal Projects:** Detailed breakdowns of my current side projects, including my first public repository, [attiny85-vehicle-charge-monitor](https://github.com/DraakUSA/attiny85-vehicle-charge-monitor).

My first major project post here will be a detailed breakdown of the **CI/CD pipeline architecture** for a modern multi-service application, reflecting my experience with **AWS and Azure/Jenkins**.

## 🤝 Open for Challenges (And Opportunities)

As a **Senior Software Engineer and Systems Architect**, I am currently open to exploring **new full-time roles, consulting opportunities, and projects** where deep architectural expertise is valued.

This site is not just a showcase—it’s a living demonstration of my skills. I invite recruiters and hiring managers to review my technical discussions and project implementations.

* You can find my full professional history and endorsements on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dewerk/)**.
* For detailed background, please **[View my Resume (PDF)](https://github.com/DraakUSA/draakusa.github.io/raw/main/assets/resume/DraakUSA_Resume.pdf)**.

I look forward to this journey of sharing and learning. Thank you for visiting the Lair!
