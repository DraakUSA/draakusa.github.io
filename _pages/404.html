    <blockquote style="border-left: 5px solid #ff4500; padding-left: 15px;">

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Check the URL:</strong> Did you misspell the ancient decree?</li>
      <li><strong>Return to Safety:</strong> Head back to the <a href="/">Homepage</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Search the Lair:</strong> Use the search bar (if available) to find the correct path.</li>
      <li><strong>Report the Incident:</strong> If you believe this is a valid link that was unjustly burned, please <a href="https://github.com/DraakUSA/draakusa.github.io/issues/new" target="_blank">let me know</a>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <small>Thank you for your understanding. And please, try not to step on the hoard.</small>
